# Overview
For the Traffic Light Package, change the flow of colours. So currently it is Red, Green, Amber, Red. The new flow should be Red, Green, Amber, Blue, Red.

Create a state design pattern for Black Jack. There should be four states:
* ``ReadyToPlayState``
* ``StickState``
* ``TwistState``
* ``EndState``
The reason for this change is try to make BlackJack similar so the logic of moving states is not done using the state design pattern. We could now easily add a state to take a bet without effecting the core logic in BlackJack of how to play the game,

## Traffic Light Instructions
* Go to the TrafficLight package
* Create a Blue enumerator in the ``LightColour`` - Easy
* Create a new sub-class state called ``BlueState`` that implements `ColourState` - Easy
  * This should trigger the ``RedState`` - Easy
* Amend the AmberState to trigger the ``BlueState`` - Easy
* Run the ``TrafficLight`` to get Red, Green, Amber & Blue - Easy


## Black Jack Assignment Instructions
### ``StickState``
* No change required
* Look and understand how the class is setup and method used
* Run tests for ``StickState`` - This verification step to double check everything works.

### ``TwistState``
* Make use of the ``PlayerState`` interface - Easy

### ``ReadyToPlayState``
* If action is twist set state to a ``TwistState`` instance - Easy

### ``ReadyToPlayStateTest``
* Run tests - Easy - This verification step to double check your changes have worked

### ``TwistState``
* Play a card to the hand - Easy
* If players score is above max score set the game state to EndState - Moderate
* Else set to ``ReadyToPlayState`` - Easy

### ``TwistStateTest``
* Run tests - Easy - This verification step to double check your changes have worked

### ``EndState``
* determine winner - Easy

### ``EndStateTest``
* Run tests - Easy - This verification step to double check your changes have worked

### ``BlackJack``
* Play game - Easy - This verification step to double check your changes have worked

### Advanced
* Restart the game with new cards dealt if not end game - Advanced

* Restart the game with new cards dealt if not end game
  * if end action passed end the game else
    * Remove cards from each player so they no longer have the previous hand
    * deal the cards
    * restart the game, what is the starting state to go to
* Play BlackJack
